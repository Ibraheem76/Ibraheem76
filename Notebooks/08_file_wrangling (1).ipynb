    "# Computer Programming\n",
    "## Programs 7: File Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final two practicals, we are moving away from Jupyter Notebooks to writing programs that run \"on their own\". Notebooks are great for small pieces of code, and are widely used in Data Science, but we want to end by looking at something more general.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will create some programs that make use of data in files. We will read data from files, and write results back.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint: There are examples of file use in the program library that came with your module repo. That would be an excellent place to start._\n",
    "_As usual, once finished, make sure this Notebook ends up in your GitHub repo._\n",
    "## File Locations\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously in order to use a file we need to know where it is on the computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "A file's location consists of its name, and the name of the folder (directory) in which it is stored. So examples might be (Linux/Mac first, then Windows):\n",
    "\n",
    "    /home/users/voldemort/horcruxes.txt\n",
    "    C:\\Users\\volde\\Documents\\horcruxes.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "A program can either process a file from its full location, or from just its name **if it is in the same location as the program**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these exercises you can put your data files in the same folder as your Notebook. But this is untidy, so we recommend creating a new folder called something like ``data`` _below_ your Notebooks folder, and then referencing files there:\n",
    "\n",
    "    data/useful_data.txt\n",
    "    data\\useful_data.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this can be error-prone, always make sure you can open the file before starting on the program that will use it!\n",
    "## Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following before trying the programs below. Where you write code, make sure it runs without errors (or with the errors you expect!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that there are two styles of file-handling. (Basically one uses ``with`` for simplicity.) The question below ask about both, but for the programs, stick with, ah, ``with``.\n",
    "_Create a code block below, with the line that would open a file called ``data.txt`` that is located **in the same folder as the program**. Don't use ``with``._\n",
    "f = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "_Create a code block below, with the line that would open a file called ``data.txt`` that is located **in a folder called ``data`` inside the folder containing the program**. Don't use ``with``._\n",
    "f = open(\"data/data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "_Finally, create a code block below, with the line that would open a file called ``data.txt`` that is located **in a folder called ``data`` above the folder containing the program**. Don't use ``with``._\n",
    "f = open(\"../data/data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "_What Exception would be thrown if opening the file fails because the file cannot be found?_\n",
    "FileNotFoundError\n",
    "_What about the Exception if the file does exist, but the user does not have access rights to use it?_\n",
    "PermissionError\n",
    "_What changes in the code if we want to write the file? Create that line in a code block below._\n",
    "f = open(\"data.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "\n",
    "_If a file is opened for writing, and does not exist, is that an error? What happens?_\n",
    "It is created automatically\n",
    "_If a file is opened for writing, and already exists, what happens to the existing contents of the file?_\n",
    "Its contents are erased\n",
    "_And add below a code block with the code to add to the end of a file when opening it._\n",
    "f = open(\"data.txt\", \"a\")\n",
    "\n",
    "_To complete the circle, create a code block and add the line to close a file after it has been written._\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "_Create a code block below, and use ``with`` to open a file, read all the lines, and display the number of lines in the file._\n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint: This is the Unix ``wc`` command. Look in your program library._\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    lines = f.readlines()\n",
    "    print(len(lines))\n",
    "\n",
    "_What is the difference between the ``read``, ``readline``, and ``readlines`` methods when reading from a file? What data types do you get from each?_\n",
    "Read returns an entire file as one string and its type is str.readline returns the next line only and its type is str. readlines returns all lines and its type is list str\n",
    "_The method to write to a file is (excitingly) called ``write``. How do we add a new line to a file using this?_\n",
    "f.write(\"Hello\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "_If using ``with`` what needs to be done in order to close a file after it has been used?_\n",
    "You don't do anything as the file closes automatically when the with block ends.\n",
    "## Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now complete these. Use ``with``, as that is the modern way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to be very sure where you have stored your data files!\n",
    "_Write a program that simply tells you whether a file exists and can be opened. Just assign the name of the file to a string variable. (The easiest way to do this is just to try and open it, and report whether or not an Exception happens.)_\n",

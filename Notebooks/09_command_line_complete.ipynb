    "## Programs 8: Using the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will create some \"standalone\" programs that will run from the command-line. These will mainly just be variations on some of the programs from last week, with the difference that the file name will come from the command-line rather than being hard-coded into the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint: There are examples of using the command-line in the program library that came with your module repo. As with last week, that would be an excellent place to start.*\n",
    "*As usual, once finished, make sure this Notebook ends up in your GitHub repo.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows (and the Apple OS that went before it) has a lot to answer for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting these programs make sure you can access the command-line on your chosen OS. If Linux, you just have it (it will be on a menu). For Mac, you are looking for `Terminal`. For Windows, you are best off seeking `PowerShell`, or maybe just switching to a proper Operating System.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that issuing the command to start Python works at your command-line. On Linux or Mac this will be `python3`. Windows is, as usual, more complicated: it will probably be `py`, or if not `python` or possibly `python3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**All this means that you will need to create the programs below in separate files so that you can run them from the command-line. It's probably easiest to create a new folder below your Notebooks for this, and then to copy-and-paste the final programs into this Notebook. Remember they will NOT run correctly in the Notebook.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: Another possibility for Windows users is to look into the \"Windows Subsystem for Linux\", which should provide a proper Operating System (Linux) running on a Windows machine.*\n",
    "\n",

    "## Practice\n",

    "Answer the following before trying the programs below.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Suppose we have a program called `useful.py` that processes a data file. The name of the data file is provided on the command-line. What is the command to run this program with a file called `interesting.dat`?*\n",
    "**`python3 useful.py interesting.dat`** (or **`py useful.py interesting.dat`** on Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "*What module must be imported in order to use the command-line?*\n",
    "**`import sys`**\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is the name of the variable that is populated with the items from the command line?*\n",
    "**`sys.argv`**\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is found in the first element of the variable containing the command-line?*\n",
    "**The name of the program itself (e.g., `\"useful.py\"`).**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Suppose a program is run as so:*\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python3 my_program.py cheese banana haloumi\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*What are the command-line arguments? What variable would each be found in?*\n",
    "**They are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"cheese\"` → `sys.argv[1]`\n",
    "* `\"banana\"` → `sys.argv[2]`\n",
    "* `\"haloumi\"` → `sys.argv[3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "*If the first command-line argument is the name of file that the program will process, what is the easiest way to check that this file exists and can be read?*\n",
    "**Try opening it inside a `try/except` block**\n",
    "(like previous weeks).\n",
    "\n",
    "*And what Exception would be thrown if the command-line argument in the above example was missing? When?*\n",
    "**`IndexError`**, thrown **when accessing `sys.argv[1]` if it does not exist**.\n",
